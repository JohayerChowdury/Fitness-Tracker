# Fitness-Tracker
Im in the midst of creating a MERN stack application that can allow users to login, track their their fitness and health metrics, and view them in informative visualizations.

Using MongoDB to store data in a non-relational database 

Using Node (and Express) and other npm libraries to set up the server-side environment

Using React (and other packages such as Bootstrap) to set up the front-end environment for client interface.
